FlatIron P1 Project - Codename: ArtMash

-> I would like to find a simple way to reinvest people in works of art.  I feel that it is getting lost on our society and want to see if there is someway to re-engage the two.  I hope to achieve this by using ArtMash.  Future plans would include storing the comments and selections to form an algorithm to suggest current retail decor options.

-> Goals
  1. Communicate with the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API
  2. Display the images of four random pieces and include artist and title information 
  3. Commenting on any piece as much as the user would like
  4. Allow user to vote on which they like most (system displays that choice)
  5. Refresh cycle to #2

-> Challenges
  1. Skipping invalid objects or objects without imagesGetting all images to the same size without disrupting natural ratios
  2. Getting all images to the same size without disrupting natural ratios
